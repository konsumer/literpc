This is a very lightweight RPC protocol I designed to be easy to parse in any language, originally designed for sending commands over wasm, without adding too much code to the wasm.

The basic idea is that the first byte is a "command" (`uint16`) and the rest is encoded bytes, and both sides need to know the structure. Think of it as very low-end grpc/protobuf. It's optimized for encoding/decoding-speed & simplicity, and although the outputted bytes are not as small as possible, the size beats other serialization-formats.

This allows you to expose a single function in your wasm-host (or whatever else) that can respond to RPC-requests, and get/set complex params/responses.

Here is how you compile the C test:

```
npm run test:c
```

## schema

I have a json format that can be used to generate bindings for different languages. It looks like this:

```json
{
  "Point": {
    "x": "Float32",
    "y": "Float32"
  },
  "MyThing": {
    "id": "Int32",
    "location": "Point",
    "name": "String"
  },
  "ops": [
    "NONE",
    "MESS_WITH_MY_THING"
  ]
}
```

Here are the valid-types:

- `Int64`
- `Uint64`
- `Float64`
- `Int32`
- `Uint32`
- `Float32`
- `Int16`
- `Uint16`
- `Int8`
- `Uint8`
- `String`
- `SomethingElse` - use another message in the definition (like in above example, with `Point`)

Additionally, you can also append `[]` for an array, like `Uint8[]`.

The bytes look like this:

```js
[COMMAND, LENGTH, BYTES..., LENGTH, BYTES..., etc]
```

> [!NOTE]
> This requires lengths & counts to be `<65,536`, since they are `Uint16` type. If you need more than that, break your message up into smaller pieces.

- You can skip an unused field by setting size to 0.
- All numeric values are encoded little-endian (which matches WASM and most modern things.)
- submessages put LENGTH in COMMAND position

Here is the breakdown of how it's encodes:

```js
[
  1,0,               // op = 1

  4,0,               // id:len = 4
  123,0,0,0,         // id:i32 = 123

  14,0,              // location:len = 14
  4,0,               // location.x:len = 4
  0,0,128,63,        // location.x:f32 = 1.0
  4,0,               // location.y:len = 4
  0,0,0,64,          // location.y:f32 = 2.0

  11,0,              // name:len = 11

  84, 101, 115, 116, // name:bytes
  32,  69, 110, 116,
  105, 116, 121,
]
```

## usage

### javascript

You can install with this:

```
npm i @konsumer/litetrpc
```

Or use it on the web:

```html
<script type="importmap">
  {
    "imports": {
      "@konsumer/litetrpc": "@konsumer/litetrpc"
    }
  }
</script>
<script type="module">
import { serialize, deserialize } from '@konsumer/litetrpc'
</script>
```

You can do this in javascript:

```js
import { serialize, deserialize } from '@konsumer/litetrpc'
import { readFile } from 'node:fs/promises'

const {ops, ...defs} = JSON.parse(await readFile('tools/defs.example.json', 'utf8'))

const thing = {
  id: 123,
  location: {x: 1, y: 2 },
  name: 'Test Entity'
}

const bytes = serialize(ops.indexOf('MESS_WITH_MY_THING'), defs, 'MyThing', thing)
const [command, decoded] = deserialize(defs, 'MyThing', bytes)
```

### C

I created a tool to generate light C code from my JSON format (similar to what you see in [test.c](tools/test.c).) Use it like this:

```
node tools/literpc_gen_c.js tools/defs.example.json
```

Since C has no JSON parser built-in, I left out parsing the schema files, but with this technique, you can see how to serialize/deserialize your structs.

### python

I created a [python library](literpc.py). Use it like this:

```py
import literpc
import json

# load ops/defs from JSON
with open('tools/defs.example.json') as data:
  defs = json.load(data)
  try:
    ops = defs['ops']
    del defs['ops']
  except:
    ops = []

# test object
thing = {
  'id': 123,
  'location': {'x': 1, 'y': 2},
  'name': 'Test Entity'
}

b = literpc.serialize(ops.index('MESS_WITH_MY_THING'), defs, 'MyThing', thing)

o = literpc.deserialize(defs, 'MyThing', b)
```
